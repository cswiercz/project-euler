# Project Euler Solutions

My solutions to Project Euler problems in various programming languages.

## Goal

The primary goal is to practice advanced uses of various programming languages.
My research is written in C, Cython, and Python so I don't have many
opportunities to use other languages.

## Languages

* C++: the "English" of programming languages
* Lisp: makes you a better programmer
